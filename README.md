# Sentiment Analysis Flask Web App

This project is an end-to-end machine learning web application built using Flask that performs sentiment analysis on user-input text. The sentiment analysis model is developed using **Scikit-learn** and **VADER Sentiment Analysis**, a rule-based tool that excels in analyzing sentiment from social media and other text domains.

### Key Features:
- **Sentiment Analysis Model**: Uses **VADER Sentiment Analysis** and machine learning with **Scikit-learn** for text polarity detection.
- **Flask Integration**: Web interface built using Flask allows users to input text and receive real-time sentiment analysis.
- **Libraries Used**: Includes popular libraries like Flask, Sklearn, NLTK, RE, Requests, and VADER Sentiment.

### Libraries Used:
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the app.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used to create the sentiment model.
- **Requests**: To handle HTTP requests within the app.
- **NLTK**: The Natural Language Toolkit for text processing.
- **RE**: Regular expressions for text preprocessing.
- **VADER Sentiment**: A rule-based model for general sentiment analysis, specifically tuned for social media.

## What is VADER Sentiment?

[VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)](https://pypi.org/project/vaderSentiment/) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is particularly effective for social media text, but it also works well in other domains. It calculates a sentiment score for a given text, considering the intensity of both positive and negative sentiments.

## About Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis, a key task in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, involves determining the emotional tone expressed in text. It can be used to classify the polarity of a text—whether it’s positive, negative, or neutral—or delve deeper into sentiment states and intensity.

Common use cases include:
- **Product Reviews**: Understanding customer feedback to guide product improvements.
- **Social Media Analysis**: Monitoring brand sentiment on platforms like Twitter and Facebook.
- **Market Research**: Analyzing public opinion to inform strategic business decisions.

Sentiment analysis can be used in various domains such as:
- Online reviews (e.g., Amazon, IMDb)
- Social media posts
- Public interviews, opinion polls, and surveys

### Application Output:

The app analyzes user-input text and provides sentiment feedback in the form of a score, indicating whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. 

#### Example Output:
